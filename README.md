### About this project

At first, my goal with this project was to practice javascript's date object. But, after some struggling with it, I decided to use a library called "luxon" which makes my life so much easier.

So, With this project you can select a country and get the current time of that, along, of course, with a acceptable interface. The second function of this project is "Timer" (Actually, I decided to make this one because I use timers a lot in my daily activities).

Probably, I'm gonna make a lot of changes in code (i.e a lot of refactoring) because, actually, I am not happy with this early code state.

###UPDATES

##05/08/2021
I made some really cool stuff in this day. I finally finished the "timer" function made "manually" with javascript vanilla (i.e without JS Date or other library). I also made some improvements in the UI, even though I'm still not happy with it. (I'm gonna work on it).
Also, I discovered how to stop a setInteval(). (This is gonna help me so much in future projects).

For the next updates, I'm gonna focus on improve the code.
