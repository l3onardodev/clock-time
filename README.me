##About this project

At first, my goal with this project was to practice javascript's date object. But, after some struggling with it, I decided to use a library called "luxon" which makes my life so much easier.

So, With this project you can select a country and get the current time of that, along, of course, with a acceptable interface. The second function of this project is "Timer" (Actually, I decided to make this one because I use timers a lot in my daily activities).

Probably, I'm gonna make a lot of changes in code (i.e a lot of refactoring) because, actually, I am not happy with this early code state.
